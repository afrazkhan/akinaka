TODO:

Encrypted manual snapshots that don't use the default RDS encryption key can be shared, but you must
first share the KMS key with the account that you want to share the snapshot with. To share the key
with another account, share the IAM policy with the primary and secondary accounts. Shared encrypted
snapshots can't be restored directly from the destination account. First, copy the snapshot to the
destination account by using a KMS key in the destination account.
